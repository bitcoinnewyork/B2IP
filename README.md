# B2IP
Bitcoin NewYork Improvement Proposals

All People who hope to improve the bitcoin for its better future and its principal in decentralized nature can contribute via B2IP. 
People wishing to submit B2IPs, first should propose their idea or document to the mailing list. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving B2IPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a B2IP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bitcoin NewYork users.

Let the Blockchain being Decentralized Forever!
